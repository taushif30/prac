    <h3>Q1- Difference between “ == “ and “ === “ operators.?    </h3>
    <pre>
    <b>ANS:</b> 1:"==" only checks value.Also Known as "Equility Operator"
         2: "===" checks values as well as data types , also known as "Strictly Operator"

    </pre>
    <br><hr><br>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->
    <h3>Q2 - What are the differences between var, let and const?</h3>
    <pre>
    <b>ANS:</b>VAR:- We can redeclare reassign it, also we can use it in Global and Local variable.Also support HOISTING.Was ther in ES5.Function and Global Scope.
          var a=10;
          var a=20; //Redeclare
          a=30;  //Reinitialized
          
        LET:We cannot redeclare it but we can reassign it .No HOISTING can be perform.Introduced in ES6.Block scope and global scope.


        CONST: We cannot redeclare it or cannot reassign it.Introduced in ES6.Block and Global scope.
    </pre><br><hr><br>
    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------- -->
   <h3>Q3 -What is hoisting?</h3>
   <pre>
    <b>ANS:</b> JS mechanism in which when we access variable before declaring it or calling function without declaring them . It works only with VAR keyword. Cannot work in first class function.
          Console.log(a)
          var a=10; //UNDEFINED

          abc();
          function abc(){
            console.log("Hello") //Hello
          }
   </pre><br><hr><br>
   <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->
   <h3>Q4 -What is a Temporal Dead Zone?</h3><br>
   <pre>
    <b>ANS:</b>The Temporal Dead Zone (TDZ) is a concept introduced in ECMAScript 6 (ES6) that refers to a specific behavior that occurs when trying to access a variable before it has been <br>             declared using the let or const keyword.Return : Refrence Error.
         Benefit : Improve the code quality.

   <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->

   <h3>Q5 -What is execution context?</h3><br>
   <pre>
    <b>ANS:</b>When the JavaScript engine scans a script file, it makes an environment called the Execution Context that handles the entire transformation and execution of the code.
   </pre><br><hr><br>
   <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->
   
   
   <h3>Q6 - What is First class function?</h3><br>
   <pre>
    <b>ANS :</b>JS mechanism when we assign a function to a variable ,where variable act like a function ,like :-
           Let a= function abc(){
            console.log("Hello")
           }
           p();
           
    <b>OUTPUT :</b> Hello       
   </pre><br><hr><br>
   <!-- --------------------------------------------------------- -->
   <h3>Q7- What is Pure Function ?</h3>
   <pre>
   <b>ANS:</b>Pure functions are functions that don't produce side effects and, when called with the same input parameters, will always return the same output.

   function sum (a,b){
    return a*b
   }
   sum(10,20) //200
   sum(20,20) //400
   </pre><br><hr><br>
   <!-- -------------------------------------------------------- -->
   <h3>Q8 - What is Execution Context?</h3>
   <pre>
    
       "SYCNCHRONOUS JAVASCRIPT"
    <b>ANS:</b>1:Global execution context.
          2:Function execution context.
          3:Memory allocation.
          4:Code execution5:Call stack.

        "ASCYNCRONOUS JAVASCRIPT"
        1:Event loop.
        2:Callback queue.
        call stack.

<!-- 19\36\2023 -->
  <h3>Q9-what is event loop and call stack? </h3>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>Event loop in JavaScript is a mechanism through which the 'calls waiting for execution' in the callback queue/job queue can be put on the call stack. For any event from the callback queue/job queue to <br>come to call stack, the call stack will have to be empty.
        
  </pre><br><hr><br>

  <!----------------------------------------------------------------------->
  <h3>Q10-What is creation phase and execution phase?  </h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>CREATION PHASE: it is one of phase of execution context where we declare varisble.
        EXECUTION PHASE: it is one of the phase of execution context where we assing value to variable.
  </pre><br><hr><br>

  <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------- -->

  <h3>Q11-What is the spread operator? </h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>The JavaScript spread operator ( ... ) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
  </pre><br><hr><br>
  <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------- -->
  <h3>Q12-What is the use of setTimeout?</h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>The global setTimeout() method sets a timer which executes a function or specified piece of code once the timer expires.
  </pre><br><hr><br>
  <!-- ------------------------------------------------------ -->
  <h3>Q13-What are callbacks?  </h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>A JavaScript callback is a function which is to be executed after another function has finished execution. A more formal definition would be - Any function that is passed as an argument <br>to another function so that it can be executed in that other function is called as a callback function.
  </pre><br><hr><br>

  <!-- ------------------------------------------------------- -->

  <h3>Q14-What is callback hell? </h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>Callback hell is a phenomenon that happens when multiple callbacks are nested on top of each other. The two common ways of escaping the callback heare are by using promises and <br>async/await. Promises mainly have three stages such as resolved, rejected, and pending. It makes the code more maintainable and understandable.
  </pre><br><hr><br>
  <!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->

  <h3>Q15-Difference between undefined vs not defined vs NaN?</h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>undefined isn't converted into any number, so using it in maths calculations returns NaN. NaN (Not-A-Number ) represents something which is not a number, even though it's actually a number.
  </pre><br> <hr> <br>

  `<h1>DAY-3</h1><br>

  <h3>What are promises and why do we need them?</h3><br>
   <pre> - Promise are use to handle async operation in JS. easy to handle callback hell, also use to handle the error.
    - basically in promise there are Three stage
        1. Pending
        2. Resolve - (then method)
        3. reject - (catch mentod)
    - initial stage of any promise is always pending.</pre><br><hr><br>
<!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
<h3>Q - We have three promise, and we want to combine all then and catch method by using <b>Promise.all</b></h3><br><hr><br>
<!-- --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<h3>Q-What is promise chaining?</h3><br>
  <pre>  - its a technique to chain multiple asynchronous operation together using promises.
    - Promise chaining is a technique in JavaScript to execute multiple asynchronous operations in a specific order by chaining promises together using the then method
    - Multiple .then method.</pre><br><hr><br>
    <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->
  
<h3>- Document Object Model?</h3><br>
<pre>- Document object model. basically it is javascript mechanism by which we can change the document structure, style, and content.
    - DOM is the data representation of the objects that comprise the structure and content of a document on the web.
    - Different method in DOM
      - Id - getElementById - return unique value
      - querySelector -       return unique value    
      - Class - getElementsByClassName 
      - tag Name - getElementsByTagName
      - querySelectorAll 

    - addEventListener - (event, callback function)</pre><br><hr><br>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<h3>Closure ?</h3><br> 
<pre>- A closure is the combination of a function bundled together (enclosed) with references to its surrounding state (the lexical environment).
    - Closure is the combination of two function (min).
    - inner function is able to excess the outer function variable but vise-varsa not possible.
    - outer func and inner func is going to create a Lixical environment.</pre><br><hr><br>
    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<h3>How many operators do we have in JS ?</h3><br>
<pre>1. Arithemic operator
       1. Add, Sub, Multi, Div(/), Module (%), Expontial (**), increment ++, decrement--
    2. Assignment Operator
       1. Assign (=), Add Assign (+=), Sub Assign (-=), (*=), (/=), (%=)
    3. Bitwise Operator
       1. Bitwise OR (|), Bitwise AND (&), Bitwise NOT (~), Left shift (<<), right shift(>>)
    4. Comparision Operator
       1. equal (==), strict equal (===), Not equal (!=), Strict Not equal (!==), greate than, less than, greate than equal, less than equal
    5. Logical Operator
       1. AND (&&)
       2. OR (||)
       3. Not (!)
    6. Ternary Operator
       1. (Condition) ? "Execute True Condition" : "Execute False Condition"
    7. typeof Operator
       1. return datatype</pre><br><hr><br>
       <!-- ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- -->


<h3>What are objects in javascript?</h3><br>
<pre>- Non-premitive data type
    - store date in the form of Key-Value pair saparated by colon.
    - Key - Properties : Value </pre><br><hr><br>

    <!-- ----------------------------------------------------- -->


    <h1>DAY-04</h1><br><br>
    <h3>Q1:Function Constructor ?</h3><br>
    <pre>
    <b>ANS:</b>- A function constructor is a way to create a object using a function as a blue print or template.
    - it allow you to define a reusable structure for creating multiple object with similar properties and method.
    </pre><br><hr><br>
  <!-- --------------------------------------------------- -->

  <h3>Q2:Call, Apply and Bind ?</h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b> These all three methods are used to invoke a function where we are supposed to pass an object as first argument and at the time of definition we don't have mention this object as a parameter and we can <br>access the values of object by using this keyword in function definition.
  - Call : The call method is used to invoked a function with a specific 'this' value, and arguments provide individuly.
  - The call() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest of the arguments required by function will be provided as an individual arguments.
  - Apply : Apply is similar with call, but take argument as an array.
  -  The apply() method invokes a function in which first argument will be the object and rest of the arguments will be passed as an array of elements.
  - Bind - Bind is a function that helps you create another function that you can execute later with the new context of this that is provided.
  - The bind() method returns a new function and this function will be having the reference of the object passed, now whenever you want to use this returned function in the code you can use it by <br>passing rest of the arguments.
  </pre><br><hr><br>
  <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------- -->

  <h3>Q3:Async/Await ?</h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b> An async function is a function declared with the async keyword, and the await keyword is permitted within it. The async and await keywords enable asynchronous,<br> promise-based behavior to be written in a cleaner style, avoiding the need promise chains.
  </pre><br><hr><br>

  <!-- ------------------------------------------------------------ -->
  <h3>Q4: Inheritance?</h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming that allows objects to inherit properties and methods from other objects. It enables code reuse, promotes modularity, and <br>facilitates the creation of hierarchical relationships between objects.
  - In JavaScript, inheritance is typically achieved through prototype-based inheritance. Objects in JavaScript can have a prototype, which is another object from which they inherit properties and methods.
  </pre><br><hr><br>
  <!-- ------------------------------------------------------- -->
  <h3>Q5:Prototype?</h3><br>
  <pre>
  <b>ANS:</b>- The prototype is an object that is associated with every JavaScript object. It serves as a blueprint or template for creating new objects through inheritance. <br>The prototype object contains properties and methods that are shared among all instances created from it.
